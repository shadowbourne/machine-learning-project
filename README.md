# machine-learning-project
A brief project and report on using the OULAD data set to predict and return a CSV of students final grades, from a variety of features, using a Random Forest or an SVC.

See classifier.py for full readme and instructions.

On default parameters, this script will first train and test a Random Forest, then print statistics of the test before exporting all predicted results to a file called "PREDICTED_GRADES.csv".
This script is also capable of running with an SVC instead (in order to compare their performance), and has a variety of options in terms of binary vs non binary classifications on the dataset.
